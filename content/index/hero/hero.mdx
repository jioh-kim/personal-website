The name "Ji-Oh" (Pronounced like geo ðŸŒŽ) means "Brighten the World". < åœ°æ™¤ >

When my family first immigrated to Canada from South Korea, I wanted to have a "westernized" name to "fit in". When I brought it up to my mom, she told me about the meaning of my name and ever since then, I have never been prouder to have kept my beautiful Korean name. ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I am a Third-Year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Toronto and I want to develop softwares and manage products/projects that will help Brighten the World.
